Inspiration has struck and it looks easy enough to implement.
I have 3 xbox controllers to test this on and one more offbrand Rockcandy controller. I hope this will remain intercompatible. I only have S controllers and none of the updated X controllers.

All the files will be available here please follow the terms of the license.
